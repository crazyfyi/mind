## Neuroimaging
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroimaging>

> **Neuroimaging** is the use of quantitative (computational) techniques to study the [structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroanatomy "Neuroanatomy") and function of the central nervous system, developed as an objective way of scientifically studying the healthy human brain in a non-invasive manner.

# Voices
## Voice-to-skull *(V2k)*
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microwave_auditory_effect>

>The **microwave auditory effect**, also known as the **microwave hearing effect** or the **Frey effect**, consists of the human perception of audible clicks, or even speech, induced by pulsed or modulated radio frequencies. The communications are generated directly inside the human head without the need of any receiving electronic device. The effect was first reported by persons working in the vicinity of [radar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radar "Radar") [transponders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transponder "Transponder") during [World War II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II "World War II"). In 1961, the [American](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States "United States") [neuroscientist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroscientist "Neuroscientist") Allan H. Frey studied this phenomenon and was the first to publish information on the nature of the microwave auditory effect.
