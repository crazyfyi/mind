***(rough draft)***

The world is ever-changing and it's time to embrace the truths about the ***NOW*** which are rapidly prevailing due to very legitimate concerns about the future.

Whether we like it or not, entities around the world are developing technologies faster than ever thought imaginable. With this, scientist and doctors around the world have raised concerns for years about the **[ethical impacts](#ethics)** of not only their current findings but also the very near-future discoveries and technological capabilities they work tirelessly to unravel.

Consider the impacts on man-kind of some of these advancements and breakthroughs, if you will, and realize the detriment on society as a whole if certain technologies fell into the wrong hands before anyone ever suspected a thing. The world's organizations are in **a *RACE* to understand** things which are barely understood. Things that have quite serious implications on our very existence as a species.  

*I believe this "phenomena" is actually a highly-classified top-secret **research project** of the United States Government/Military and is being performed on unwilling "random" victims pulled from a pre-filtered list of matching "conditions" whom of which are being used as literal **lab rats**.* 

This document will supply answers to all the basic questions *(who, what, how, why, etc.)* backed by scientifically cited biomedical literature and credibly documented technological advancements absolutely present in today's modern world.

# WHO

There are several branches of the United States Military and Government that are tasked specifically with researching and developing AI, machine learning, human-machine teaming, and related technologies. Some of these "organizations", as they're commonly referred to as, are listed below.

## WHAT

Currently, the organization(s) responsible are using brain imaging technology to interface with the human brain and read the minds, or thoughts, of targeted individuals. Along with this, the individual is oftentimes subjected to voices which are used to further stimulate the mind of the target.

## WHY

In simple terms, they are doing this for research purposes. The main reason being there is still so much unknown about the human brain, which has been researched for decades, and the technology being deployed, which is still being actively developed, and in fact has barely breached the surface of it's capabilities, that necessitates a common need for learning. 

Once again, remember, there is a race going on that fuels this quest for knowledge which has serious implications for man-kind, depending on the "winner(s)". What I am referring to here is *ultimately* having enough of an understanding and the capabilities available to **manipulate the human-species with remote and absolute mind-control**. 

Sounds far fetched? Since the dawn of time people have often wondered what people are thinking and have since developed and used many tactics to perform just this. 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mentalism

Furthermore, every existing governing body has wanted, at least in some way, to have  access and control of their citizens. This works to fuel the lust for power and greed that we humans are infamous for. 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_forms_of_government

So, it's not that far-fetched to believe that there are governments or organizations out there with the extreme desire for absolute control. On the other end of this spectrum, there are no doubt governments or organizations who wish to prevent this chaos from occurring and/or develop a way to combat it, should it come about. Either way, a firm understanding is required in order to fulfill the desired function.

## HOW

A form of [neuroimaging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroimaging), such as [functional neuroimaging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_neuroimaging), is being used as a [brain-computer interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain%E2%80%93computer_interface) for the purpose of [brain-reading](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain-reading)

This is being driven by [AI *(Artificial intelligence)*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence), likely an [Artificial general intelligence *(AGI)*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_intelligence), using [Machine learning *(ML)*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning) to develop and interact with an [Artificial neural network *(ANN)*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_neural_network) such as a [Generative adversarial network *(GAN)*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_adversarial_network) and/or a [Convolutional neural network *(CNN/ConvNet)*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolutional_neural_network)

This is being delivered remotely via a [satellite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satellite), [atmospheric satellite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_satellite), or an [unmanned aerial vehicle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unmanned_aerial_vehicle) *(AKA drone)* using some form of energy off the [electromagnetic spectrum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_spectrum), most likely [electromagnetic radiation *(EMR)*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_radiation) with [microwaves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microwave) or perhaps sometimes utilizing directed energy, such as [lasers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser).  

As far as voices being delivered, that has been done for decades using [Voice-to-skull *(V2k)*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microwave_auditory_effect) technology but I believe newer forms are in use interfacing with the brain directly using the above listed forms.
